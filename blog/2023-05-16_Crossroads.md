# On the Crossroads of Many Paths: My Journey Through Diverse Interests
Hello Everyone,

Welcome to my first blog post! I am Tarun Subramanian, a student of life and an explorer at heart.

Life, in its essence, is a journey of learning and experiences. Each path we take shapes us, transforms us, and gives us a new perspective. Today, I want to share with you my journey - a diverse and multifaceted exploration across different domains and interests.

In my professional life, I’ve embraced a variety of roles. I've delved into the world of tech, worked on data migration solutions, and crafted digital solutions as a web developer. Presently, I'm navigating the realm of retail automation, installing and maintaining state-of-the-art equipment.

But what's life without a little twist? Parallel to my tech journey, I've also taken a step into the world of acting and stunts. I've had the opportunity to play roles in local productions, even performing stunts in front of cameras. This has been a unique experience, one that has taught me to express myself creatively and to step outside of my comfort zone.

Yet, the diversity doesn't end there. I've also been part of a management team at a hotel group. This role allowed me to delve into operations, finance, and event management, and even oversee the implementation of health and safety protocols during pandemic times.

Beyond work, I'm a multilingual individual, fluent in English, Russian, Hindi, and Tamil, and I am deeply interested in martial arts, practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Karate, Kickboxing, and Wrestling. I believe that embracing such diverse interests has made me a well-rounded individual, capable of looking at problems from different perspectives.

In this blog, I aim to share my experiences from my multifaceted journey. From discussing the management of a business in a pandemic to sharing tips about performing stunts, from delving into the world of languages and cultures to exploring the discipline and philosophy of sports and martial arts, I hope to cover a wide range of topics that reflect the diversity of my interests and experiences.

I look forward to sharing my journey with you and hope to inspire you to embrace diversity in your own lives. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments, or topics you’d like me to explore on my [contact page](https://tarun010.pythonanywhere.com/contact/).

Stay tuned for more posts and exciting discussions!
